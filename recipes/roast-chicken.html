    <h2>This is a recipe for roast chicken, by LILQUIZ</h2>
    <p>
      When I was in Vicenza, Italy at an open market downtown, I smelled this
      scrumptious smell of roast chicken at this stand. So I bought one of their
      chickens and looked what they stuffed in the cavity to make it taste so
      good! I also do my turkeys like this too!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, rinsed</li>
      <li>1 small onion, quartered</li>
      <li>Â¼ cup chopped fresh rosemary</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Season chicken with salt and pepper to taste. Stuff with the onion and
        rosemary. Place chicken in a 9x13 inch baking dish or roasting dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roast in the preheated oven for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, or until chicken is
        cooked through and juices run clear. Cooking time will vary a bit
        depending on the size of the bird.
