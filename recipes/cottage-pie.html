      <h2>This is a recipe for cottage pie, by KMOMMYZ</h2>
      <p>
        This recipe is from my Gram who is English. She served this often, and I
        have modified her recipe for my family and this is it. A great
        alternative to Shepherd's Pie.
      </p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>4 large Yukon Gold potatoes, quartered</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1Â½ cups frozen peas</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon herbes de Provence</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9 inch
          deep-dish pie plate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place potatoes into a pot; cover with salted water, and bring to a
          boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover; simmer until
          tender, about 20 minutes. Drain; mash with 2 tablespoons of the butter
          and the garlic. Season to taste with salt and pepper; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add
          ground beef, herbes de Provence, and nutmeg; cook and stir until beef
          is lightly brown and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Spread the beef evenly
          in the prepared pie plate. Cover evenly with the peas; spread the
          mashed potatoes over the peas. Dot the casserole with the remaining
          butter.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until heated through and
          bubbly, about 20 minutes.
        </li>
      </ol>
